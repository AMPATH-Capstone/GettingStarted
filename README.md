# Getting Started with GitHub 

### What is GitHub? 
In short, Github is a web-based platform used for version control. It is helpful when more than just one person is working on a project. For the purposes of our project, all changes can be made using the website version of Github. 

### What is a Repository? 
A repository (usually abbreviated to “repo”) is a location where all the files for a particular project are stored. Each project has its own repo, and you can access it with a unique URL. 

For the purposes of our Github, we will have the following repos _(this list can be updated as we have identified working groups)_ : 

- [Data Prep](https://github.com/AMPATH-Capstone/DataPrep)
- [Workstream One](https://github.com/AMPATH-Capstone/WorkstreamOne)
- [Workstream Two](https://github.com/AMPATH-Capstone/WorkstreamTwo)
- [Workstream Three](https://github.com/AMPATH-Capstone/WorkstreamThree)
